Hi, I'm Athena, an undergraduate at UW Seattle majoring in Computer Science and Applied Mathematics.

Currently, my main interests are in machine learning and quantitative trading; both are excellent opportunities for me to apply the mathematics I've learned.

In my spare time, I like to teach myself more math, work on personal projects, and host tabletop game sessions for my friends.
